# Overview

This repository contains code to create a basic raytracer in C. I am using the excellent book "Raytracing In One Weekend" by Peter Shirley to achieve this.

## Running code

The code is written in C and must be compiled before it will run, execute the render.sh script under the c++ directory to compile, run, and pipe PPM stream to rendered.ppm image.
