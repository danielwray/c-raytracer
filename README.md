# Overview

This repository contains code to create a basic raytracer in C++. I am using the excellent book series "Raytracing In One Weekend", "Raytracing: the Next Week", and "Raytracing: the Rest of Your Life" by Peter Shirley to achieve this.

## Running code

The code is written in C++ and must be compiled before it will run, execute the ```render.sh``` script under the c++ directory to compile, run, and pipe PPM stream to rendered.ppm image.
